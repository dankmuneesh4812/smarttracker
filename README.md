Arduino Nano 33 IoT Sensor Data Collection and Storage using MQTT and MongoDB

Project Description
This project uses an Arduino Nano 33 IoT board, ADXL335 accelerometer, MAX30100 pulse oximeter, and MQTT client to collect sensor data and store it in a MongoDB database. The data can then be analyzed and used for various applications.

The ADXL335 accelerometer measures acceleration and tilt of the sensor, while the MAX30100 pulse oximeter measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. The Arduino Nano 33 IoT board is used to collect data from both sensors and send it to the MQTT broker, which then stores it in the MongoDB database.
